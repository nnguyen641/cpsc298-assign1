# Applications' Purposes

This repo will contain three C++ files called "problemCereal.cpp", "problemFireCapacity.cpp", and "problemEmployeePay.cpp". The cereal file will calcuate the weight of the user's cereal box in metric tons and output how many boxes are needed to reach one metric ton. The fire capacity file determines from user input whether a room violates fire law regulations and lets the user know how many people could enter or must be excluded. The employee pay file calculates the gross pay, wilthholding amount, and net pay for one week of work.
